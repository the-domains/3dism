  When a 53-year-old man called Mr. Ravi (a pseudonym) came to Bangalore's
  Health Care Global (HCG) complaining of a mouth ulcer, at first that's all the
  doctors found. As he had been treated for tongue cancer two years ago,
  however, an MRI was taken, and the results weren't good - the tumor had
  returned, and it was much more extensive than anyone expected.
