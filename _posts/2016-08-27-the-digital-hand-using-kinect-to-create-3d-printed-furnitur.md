  Parametric is a favorite word among the digital design community. In fact, one
  of my colleagues at the university and a good friend of ours used it so often
  that six years ago, my two-year-old daughter would walk around calling
  everything parametric. It's a fancy way of saying 'something that exists in
  relation to a set of parameters.'
